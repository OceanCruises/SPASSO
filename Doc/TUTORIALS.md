# SPASSO tutorials

The following is a set of tutorials to help users to get more familiar with SPASSO
and how to change parameters and options from the config.ini file. All the examples
below starts from the most simple and standard configuration example WMedSeaExample.

> Users can find full description of the parameters defined in the config.ini file [here](https://github.com/OceanCruises/SPASSO/blob/main/config.ini)

## Standard SPASSO run
- Run standard SPASSO config (in a terminal window):
```
local@ubuntu: cd spasso2.0/src/
local@ubuntu: clear; python3 Spasso.py WMedSeaExample
```
> Spasso.py needs as an argument the name of the cruise. It is indispensable that
> the name of the cruise is <ins>exactly</ins> (i.e. case sensitive) in the repository
> and config_*.ini names. One can also define the cruise name in a variable `cr` and
> call it using `python3 Spasso.py $cr`

- Information about the run are printed on screen:

- Several directories are created in the cruise folder:
    - Bulletin: where bulletin file are stored
    - Figures: where all figures outputs are stored
    - Logs: where log files are saved
    - Processed: where netcdf files are saved
    - Wrk: the working directory. Users can check the current SPASSO run outputs there.
> Each time a new run is launched the working directory is cleaned but do not worry all files from previous run are saved in Bulletin, Figures, Processed and Logs directories.

- Figures generated by this config:
